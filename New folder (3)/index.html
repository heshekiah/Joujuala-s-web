      <h3>COMPANY HISTORY</h3>  </div>
    <div class="history">
        <p>JojuCala’s Glow Cosmetics was created by four students named Jovhie, Juliana, Monica, and Angela who were inspired by the same purpose during their time at an Institute. Their academic interests were motivated by their primary objective: developing an inexpensive skincare product that is both gentle and safe for the skin. In order to create an eco-friendly and cruelty-free skincare product, they envisioned a transformative process using natural raw ingredients.

            These students set out to found an innovative company focused on environmentally friendly cosmetics solutions because they had a common goal for a sustainable future.  The idea to create a skincare product that helps clients grow confidence while using it and lessens its impact on the environment came to them because they all had an interest in beauty products. Equipped with the expertise they had developed throughout their four years as chemical engineering students, they were committed to considering the possible effects of their product on both the environment and its target market. They noticed the immense opportunity of using squash and rice water as the major natural ingredient in a beauty product, specifically a clay mask.
